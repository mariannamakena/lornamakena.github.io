            <h1>The Spatial and Temporal Variability of Cyber Attacks in Kenya, Final year Thesis</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Geospatial data is often perceived as only being related to maps, compasses and locations. However, the application areas of geospatial data are far wider and extend to the field of cybersecurity. Geospatial data can feed into intelligence systems, help with analysis, information sharing, and help create situational awareness. Geospatial data is very powerful and can help to prioritize cyber threats and identify critical areas of concern. This study’s main aim is to investigate the integration of geospatial data in to cyber attacks monitoring and tracking.
                <br><br>The findings in the hotspot analysis and autocorrelation suggest that cyber attacks victims are not randomly distributed but are instead concentrated in certain areas with higher population densities and greater levels of internet connectivity as well as access to electricity. Specifically, the results indicate that central Kenya, including regions such as Kiambu, Nakuru and Nairobi, have a high cluster, which suggests a higher concentration of cyber attack victim in this regions. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the presence of a higher density of businesses or financial institutions that are targeted by cybercriminals or a higher level of internet usage or access to technology in this region, which could make it more vulnerable to cyber threats.
                <br><br>Through the Ordinary least squares analysis, a range of factors was considered that may influence the incidence of cyber attacks, including total population, income, access to ICT, and access to electricity. When examining the relationship between Cyber victimization and the various socio- economic factors, it was found out that total population, access to electricity and ICT access were strongly positively correlated with the cyber-attacks incidents.
                <br><br>Regions with higher populations and greater economic activity, as well as better access to electricity, had higher rates of cyber attacks. Additionally, access to ICT, such as internet connectivity and access to technology, was also positively correlated with the incidence of cyber- attacks. Regions with better access to ICT tended to have higher rates of cyber attacks, possibly due to a greater number of internet users and greater use of online platforms for financial transactions and other activities targeted by cybercriminals.
                <br><br>As part of the analysis, spatial autocorrelation techniques were used to identify clusters and outliers of Cyber victimization across the country.The results indicated that Cyber victimization is not randomly distributed in Kenya, but instead, there are distinct patterns of clustering and outliers. These findings suggest that cyber threats are concentrated in specific regions of the country, and targeted interventions may be necessary to address these challenges.
                
                <br><br>The identification of clusters and outliers of Cyber victimization can help policymakers and cybersecurity experts to develop more targeted interventions to address the root causes of cyber threats in specific regions. By identifying regions with high clusters of cyber attacks, policymakers can prioritize interventions to improve internet infrastructure and security measures in those areas, as well as provide cybersecurity training and resources to businesses and financial institutions operating in those regions. Similarly, addressing the unique challenges faced by outlier regions can help to prevent the spread of Cyber victimization and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the country.
                <br><br>The web application was created to serve five purposes: to create a platform in which cyber-attack incidents can be reported this solves the problem of data collection, platform to host a database to store the source IP addresses which can be used by cyber security experts in digital forensic investigations, real time tracking and monitoring in the web application, increases cyber security awareness through offering maps for visualization and data mining and lastly coordination and collaboration between cyber security agencies in Kenya.
                </p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>To identify and visualize where cyber attacks originate and model its growth and show its patterns.</p>
            <p>To identify the dependency factors that correlate to cyber attacks such as demographic factors, social and economic factors.</p>
            <p>To create a web application of real time monitoring and tracking for cyber attack reporting that includes a spatial database.</p>


            <h2>Methods</h2>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>From the spatial characterization of cyber attacks, there is a noticeable increase in cyber attacks from 2020 to 2021 in the hotspots maps (Figure 9). It is shown by the map that there is a centralization of cyber attack victims in the central part of Kenya, that is mostly Nairobi and Kiambu counties. There is a huge gap between cyber attacks victims from Nairobi to the rest of the towns such as Mombasa, Turkana or Mandera. This affirms that Nairobi is a major hotspot for cyber attacks given it is the capital of Kenya and where most companies and industries are located in Kenya. It also boasts as one of the counties with the highest population in Kenya which proves the positive correlation between large number of population and cyber attacks.
                Most cyber- attacks source IPs (Figure 10) originate from outside of Kenya with 88% of hackers are located globally and 12% of hackers are located internally (Communication of Authority of Kenya 2021 annual report, 2021). <br><br>Cyber attack source IP addresses were not included in the analysis due to lack of credibility of the data but were used in the creation of a database in which security experts can perform digital forensic investigation on the IPs to determine their credibility. Hackers do not use their own IP addresses but a proxy i.e. a hacker might be from Kenya however his IP address reads it’s from Afghanistan. However visually displaying the data can show huge clustering of areas or locations which target Kenya.
                Financial Fraud, phishing and spams are the most types of cyber attacks that were reported by Kenyans in the 2020 and 2021. Nairobi and Kiambu counties had the highest number of all five types of cyber attacks. This gives a picture to how also because of proximity in location between the two there is high number of cyber incidents.
                <br><br>Marsabit, Wajir, Isiolo and Garissa had little to none cyber-attack incidents. This displayed a problem or error on the data obtained. The is because the percentage of internet users in Kenya by 2020 was 42% of the whole population, according to the Communicaton Authority of Kenya, this value should have risen in 2021 due to the Covid pandemic which shifted money transactions and any mode of communication online. Thus, displaying a county with little to none number of cyber attack victims against the internet users in the same area proves to show the low reporting rate of cyber attacks.
                This can be solved through the creation of a web application that connects to a database. <br><br>
                Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a regression method that allows one to see the relationship between a dependent variable and exploratory variables. By using regression, dependency factors such as population, ICT access, electricity access that had a significant correlation with the dependent factor, cyber attacks, were able to be deduced and this were population, internet users per county and ICT access per county.<br><br>
                The identification of clusters and outliers of Cyber victimization can help policymakers and cybersecurity experts to develop more targeted interventions to address the root causes of cyber threats in specific regions. By identifying regions with high clusters of cyber attacks, policymakers can prioritize interventions to improve internet infrastructure and security measures in those areas, as well as provide cybersecurity training and resources to businesses and financial institutions operating in those regions. Similarly, addressing the unique challenges faced by outlier regions can help to prevent the spread of Cyber victimization and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the country
                In conclusion, geospatial data can be successfully integrated in a cyber space environment to monitor and track cyber attacks in an area of study</p>

            <h2>Web Application</h2>
            <p>One of the challenges faced during the analysis of the project was standardization of the data obtained. A large amount of time was spent in data cleaning and filtering as some of the areas of the cyber attacks reported required to be written in a correct manner. Moreover, the low reporting rate in the country of victims of cyber attacks shows that there is low awareness on cybercrimes. To solve this a web application was created for cyber attacks incident reporting and visualization.
                <br><br>Streamlit is an open source python based framework for developing and deploying interactive data science dashboards, web apps and machine learning models. For this research Streamlit acts as the
                frontend of the web application. The first page is the Homepage which gives statistics on the current cyber-attack scenario in Kenya from the Communication of Authority of Kenya. Analysis page displays maps in which analysis has been done on data obtained. Contact page gives information on the relevant authority and their toll number to report a cyber attack. Lastly, report page allows victims to input data to report any cyber-attack incident.
                The report page is connected to a database in the backend framework in which when the victim submits the data recorded, it is stored in the database.</br><br>
                Django is a free and open-source, Python-based web framework that follows the model– template–views architectural pattern. For this research Django acts as the backend of the web application. Backend development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website such as database administration. The backend web application is only available to administrators. This is gotten from a scenario where assuming that one works at the DCI cybercrime department, by logging in one’s credentials, access is given.
                The administrator is able to access the data stored in the database and view them on a map with all the detail recorded. The administrator may also edit or create any new data example a call comes from a victim reporting an incident, using the add cyber attack or add cyber attack victims forms, the administrator records the incident.
                The following are the screenshots of the web application both the frontend and backend of the application.</p>
