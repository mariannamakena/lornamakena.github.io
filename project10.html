            <h1>The Correlation between Climate Change, Environmental Degradation, and Public Health: A Case Study of the Emergence of New Malaria Species Anopheles Stephensi in Turkana County, Kenya</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Anopheles Stephensi are a group of mosquitoes known for their role in transmitting the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) to humans. Native to South Asian countries and parts of the Arabian Peninsula India, Anopheles Stephensi mosquitoes thrive around sewers and dirty water, making them more adaptable to urban and peri urban areas. Anopheles was first discovered in Africa in Ethiopia and Djibouti in 2012, countries that border Kenya. <br><br>
                For the Anopheles Stephensi to be discovered in Kenya it means that the conditions in the area were favorable for its breeding. These factors are climate change in terms of rainfall and temperature, land and environmental degradation and human activities. This study aims to examine the intricate relationship on how climate change affects both land and environment degradation which leads to the favorable breeding conditions of Anopheles Stephensi.<br><br>
                One unique characteristic of Anopheles Stephensi that sets it apart from other mosquito species is that it thrives in urban and peri urban areas. Scientifically researched and known, urban areas are mosquito free zones and there is little to no chance of contracting malaria in an urban setting such as Nairobi.<br><br> 
                If Anopheles stephensi were to spread in a city like Nairobi, the consequences would be serious. First, malaria could spread to the inner-city areas. Until now, these areas have had little or no transmission and their populations have not acquired immunity against malaria. Secondly, urban development would no longer be assumed to contribute to malaria elimination. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>To investigate the climate change patterns in Turkana County. Investigate the historical and current climate patterns in Turkana County assessing temperature variations, Rainfall patterns and frequency of extreme weather conditions.</p>
            <p>To analyze and assess environmental degradation including deforestation and changes in land use.</p>
            <p>To investigate the spread of malaria cases in Turkana County including the socioeconomic factors contributing to the vulnerability of the population to malaria, assess poverty levels and access to healthcare</p>
            <p>To investigate the spread of Anopheles Stephensi in Turkana including the factors that favor the breeding condition of Anopheles Stephensi in Turkana</p>
            <p>Show the correlation through R squared analysis  

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            Malaria is one of the leading causes of disease related deaths in Kenya especially in young children
            below the age of 5 years. This growing threat in Kenya is being driven by climate change, which causes
            land and environment degradation affected by human activities. Thus, various methods and solutions
            should be applied to help monitor and curb malaria transmission starting by having the information on
            what favors breeding grounds to eliminate them<br><br>
            Researchers from Kenyaâ€™s Medical Research Institute detected a new species of mosquito in the
            East African nation that has shown resistance to locally used insecticides and the potential to transmit
            malaria throughout the year, unlike traditional malaria-causing mosquitoes.<br><br>
            The mosquito species -- named Anopheles stephensi -- was previously only known to spread malaria in
            South Asia and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, according to the World Health Organization. However, it
            has been expanding geographically -- first being detected in Africa in Djibouti in 2012 -- and has since
            being found in several African nations such as Nigeria, Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan.<br><br>
            This, however, is the first time the mosquito has been detected in Kenya and its arrival is raising concern
            among researchers who say malaria transmission may continue all year round, rather than being
            seasonal due to its ability to "spread very fast to new areas" regardless of climatic and environmental
            conditions.<br><br>
            The Anopheles stephensi is unique as it thrives in man-made containers and breeding habitats in
            polluted settings. It can breed in cisterns, jerry cans, tyres, open tanks, sewers, overhead tanks,
            underground tanks and polluted environments. Furthermore, the mosquito is invasive. The
            establishment of Anopheles stephensi in urban and peri-urban areas may pose a serious threat for
            malaria transmission in areas that have been Anopheles and malaria free.<br><br>
            The fact that they are breeding successfully in hot, dry regions like Turkana should cause public health
            officials to rethink their assumptions about malarial hot spots. Data from hospitals in the area have also
            shown an uptick in malaria cases outside the usual malaria season.
